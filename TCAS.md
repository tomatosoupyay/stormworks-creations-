I decided to create a new TCAS standard. The script is still work in progress, but will be effectively universal across aircraft, since its up to you to make your own interfaces. I did this since most other TCAS systems have a set interface that isnt particularly realistic.

Inputs:
Numbers:
1: Other aircraft's X-coordinate.
2: Other aircraft's Y-coordinate.
3: Other aircraft's altitude.
4: Other aircraft's squawk code.
5: Other aircraft's tail number (ASCII). 
6: Other aircraft's type (ASCII). (72504848 is H200 for example)
7: Empty
8: Signal strength (incoming)
9: Own X-coordinate
10: Own Y-coordinate
11: Own altitude
12: Own squawk code



this is unfinished and subject to change blah blah
